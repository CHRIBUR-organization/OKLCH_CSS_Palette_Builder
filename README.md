You can make OKLCH CSS palettes using this!

## What is this?

This is a Python library which makes OKLCH CSS palettes.
OKLCH is a perceptually uniform color space designed by Bj√∂rn Ottosson in 2020 (you can read [his blog](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/)).
You can use it as CSS Color Module Level 4 with most modern browsers (check [Can I Use...](https://caniuse.com/?search=oklch)).

Although we can use [OKLCH Color Picker & Converter](https://oklch.com), I think it is not easy to use because the surface of OKLCH is not flat.
So I wrote this library for CSS developers.

## Installation

```Shell
pip install oklchcsspalette
```

## Attention

- This library does not yield Tailwind CSS color names.
- This library outputs duplicated colors; black and white.
